# steamMarketTracker
Simple project to keep an eye on the value of steam market objects.

Heavily inspired by (and initially forked from, before I decided to rewrite) https://github.com/Neph0/steamMarketWatcher

# Current Functionality
<none. it's a new project.>

# To Do
Import list from simple flat file structure such as:
```
"Object 1" 0.99
"Object 2" 4.99
```
